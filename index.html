        <h1>We & Us</h1>
        <h3>song by Moira Dela Torre</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>Rainbow notes up on the wall<br>
        Dancing children under rainfalls<br>
        Perfect sunset set to ten<br>
        Then we begin again<br>
        There's a ribbon in the sky<br>
        Painting rivers on the moonlight<br>
        Moving pictures say the words<br>
        Of a story that begins</p>

        <p>I'll hold your hand and wipe your tears<br>
        We'll laugh until we run out of years</p>

        <p>'Cause no matter if our blue skies turn to gray<br>
        There's a ray of sun that's bound to light our way<br>
        And although the roads are rough<br>
        I'll get through it just because<br>
        I'll have my you<br>
        You'll have your me<br>
        No matter what may come<br>
        We'll have our we and us</p>

        <p>Through tired eyes I see your soul<br>
        Promise you'll never be alone<br>
        When you need life I'll give you rest<br>
        When you ask for good I'll give you best</p>

        <p>And once again I was caught off guard<br>
        The best surprise is when you gave your heart</p>

        <p>So no matter if our blue skies turn to gray<br>
        There's a ray of sun that's bound to light our way <br>
        And although the roads are rough <br>
        I'll get through it just because <br>
        I'll have my you <br>
        You'll have your me <br>
        No matter what may come <br>
        We'll have our we</p>

        <p>And as you gaze at the stars tonight <br>
        I will gaze at a star more beautiful and bright <br>
        And I wish I could do this forever <br>
        It could be <br>
        You and me <br>
        We and us oh <br>
        You and me <br>
        We and us oh <br>
        You and me <br>
        We and us<br>
        Forever</p>

        <p>So no matter if our blue skies turn to gray <br>
        There's a ray of sun that's bound to light our way <br>
        And although the roads are rough <br>
        We'll get through it just because <br>
        You'll have your me <br>
        Well, I hope for you <br>
        No matter what may come <br>
        We'll have our we and us</p>
